## 2024-04-02 - [Interactive Focus and Semantic States]

**Learning:** In a card-based UI where some actions (like 'Favorite') are only visible on hover, keyboard users are often unable to discover or use those actions. Using `group-focus-within:opacity-100` alongside `group-hover:opacity-100` ensures these actions are accessible to all users. Additionally, for toggle-like buttons (like filter chips), `aria-pressed` is essential for screen readers to convey the current state.
**Action:** Always ensure that hidden interactive elements are revealed on focus of their container, and use appropriate ARIA states for toggles.
